# Blockchain Learning & Solidity Contracts

This branch contains my **blockchain development learning journey**, including hands-on practice with **Solidity**, **smart contracts**, and core **Web3 concepts**.  
All files here are part of my exploration of Ethereum development, covering topics such as:

- **Smart contract basics**
- **Functions, modifiers, events, and inheritance**
- **Mappings, structs, arrays, enums**
- **Payment handling** (`payable`, `transfer`, `call`)
- **Contract interactions & architecture patterns**
- **NFT/Storage concepts** (IPFS, CIDs)
- **Hardhat + testing workflow** *(coming soon)*

This branch will continue to grow as I build new contracts, improve my understanding of Web3, and develop the backend foundation for **AwasChain** and **GharLedger**.
